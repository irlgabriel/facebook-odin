## Description

### I have built this app to show off my rails skills. I learned a lot about rails while doing it - things like database migrations, associations, activestorage, form helpers, http requests, model-view-controller arhitecture and so many more were a lot more clear to me after finishing this app. It took me over 150 hours to complete it which I am not very proud to admit but it was not in vain. The hardest part was figuring out how to implement Friend Requests - I had no clue where to even start. I must have spent over one week trying to figure out WHAT actually is a friend request - in this app's context - then it hit me that it can be a model with it's associated controller and view. Afterwards I only needed to nitpick on the logic - things such as how to handle a rejection, sending notification in case of acceptance, removing the users who are friends from their respective "Find friends" page and so on.
